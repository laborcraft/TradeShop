        Run `/version` and `/n help` on your server and **paste** the full, unmodified output here.
        "latest" is *not* a version; we require the actual output outputs so we can adequately track down the issue.
        Additionally, do NOT provide a screenshot, you MUST paste the entire output.
        Lastly, if you use a pre-release (DEV build), add the date and time of the release as well, as often many pre-releases share the same version tag.
